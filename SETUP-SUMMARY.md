## Configuration Updated

- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` with path aliases for new feature directories
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` with path aliases for new feature directories
- ✅ Initialized git repository and committed all changes

## Feature Structure Implemented

For each feature, we've created:

1. **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
2. **Data Services**: API interaction services to connect with the backend

### ILP Feature
- Defined skill types, goal statuses, and ILP data structures
- Created services for fetching ILP data

### Gamification Feature
- Defined badge types, XP event types, and level configurations
- Created services for managing XP and badges

### Games Feature
- Defined types for both quiz and memory games
- Created services for fetching game data and saving results

### Feelings Tracker Feature
- Defined feeling types, intensities, and data visualization structures
- Created services for recording and analyzing feelings data

### AAC Feature
- Defined categories, symbol structures, and board layouts
- Created services for managing AAC boards and symbols

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for UI component implementation. The next phase should focus on:

1. Creating the actual UI components for each feature
2. Setting up contexts or state management for each feature
3. Building the page components and integrating with routing
4. Implementing hooks for specific feature logic
5. Connecting everything with the existing authentication system
