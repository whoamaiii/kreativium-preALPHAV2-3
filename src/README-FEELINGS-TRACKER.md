# Feelings Tracker Component

A modular, accessible emotional tracking system for autistic children with integrated pattern detection using Sequential Thinking MCP.

## Overview

The Feelings Tracker provides a user-friendly interface for children to log and track their emotional states, while offering educators analytical insights through visualizations and pattern detection. The component is designed with accessibility in mind and integrates with the Sequential Thinking MCP server for enhanced pattern analysis.

### Key Features

- **Emoji-based emotion logging** - Intuitive interface for children to express feelings
- **Role-based access** - Different views for children vs. teachers/educators
- **Pattern visualization** - Charts and graphs to identify emotional trends
- **Sequential Thinking analysis** - Integration with MCP server for advanced pattern detection
- **Privacy controls** - Children can only see their own data, teachers have broader access

## Component Architecture

The implementation follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

```

## Sequential Thinking MCP Integration

The Feelings Tracker leverages the Sequential Thinking MCP server for enhanced emotion pattern detection:

1. Emotion logs are processed as sequential thinking steps
2. Each step is analyzed in context of previous emotions
3. The MCP server identifies potentially significant patterns
4. Teachers receive insights about recurring emotional states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model

- `Emotion` - Type representing supported emotions (happy, sad, anxious, etc.)
- `EmotionLog` - Interface for emotion entries with timestamp and optional note
- `User` - Interface for user data including role (child/teacher)
- `PatternAnalysisResult` - Interface for analysis results

### Storage

The component uses localStorage in this implementation for simplicity, but is designed to work with:

- Firebase Firestore
- REST APIs
- MCP file storage
- SQLite or other databases

### Authentication

A simple role-based auth system controls access:
- Children can only view and log their own emotions
- Teachers can view aggregated data and individual student data
- All pattern analysis is restricted to teacher accounts

## Using the Feelings Tracker

### Child Interface

1. Select your current emotion from the emoji grid
2. Optionally add notes about why you're feeling this way
3. Submit to log the emotion with timestamp

### Teacher Interface

1. View aggregated emotion data across all students
2. Filter by specific student or time period
3. Examine different visualizations:
   - Frequency chart (pie chart)
   - Hourly patterns (bar chart)
   - Timeline visualization (line chart)
4. Review insights detected by Sequential Thinking MCP

## Installation and Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2 date-fns chartjs-adapter-date-fns nanoid
   ```

2. Ensure the Sequential Thinking MCP server is configured and running
   - The component will gracefully fall back to basic analysis if MCP is unavailable

3. Add the FeelingsTracker route to your application router

## Customization Options

The component can be extended in several ways:

1. Add additional emotions by extending the `Emotion` type and corresponding constants
2. Implement custom visualization charts in the VisualizationDashboard
3. Replace localStorage with a different data storage solution
4. Enhance the Sequential Thinking MCP processing with additional pattern detection algorithms

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- Advanced filtering capabilities (day of week, activities, etc.)
- Exportable reports for educational planning
- Customizable emotion sets per child
- Integration with class schedules for contextual analysis
- Multi-language support for international use
